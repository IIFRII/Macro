# Macro
Just some code that Iâ€™ve written or, mostly, scraped together along the way -from my first job to the current one-; please consider that I AM NOT A PROGRAMMER. These are simple tools to improve efficiency and save time. Also, I get bored pretty fast doing mindless tasks, so I try to be creative and automate the tedious stuff.

#Tools (in particular order):
1. **Resize ALL the word pictures and screen grab to a particular size** (had to print a 200+ pages documents full of screen grabs, there wasn't a chance in hell I'd resize them one by one)
